    For this weekâ€™s lab, I decided to do some research on potential careers in web design. I have always considered web design to be a potential career path for me, so researching different aspects of the job is a very good idea. At my last internship over last summer, I remember my boss telling me about one of his former colleagues that happened to know work in the web design industry. He told me that he works from anywhere that he wants in the world, and makes very good money while maintaining a very balanced life in terms of work and free time. Along with taking this class, this anecdote has persuaded me to push for a potential career in web design. To start, I simply googled the average salary for web designers. Glassdoor.com gave me a range from 48K-110K a year, so obviously there is lots of money to be made in the industry. Another thing that I learned through my research was how progressive and flexible most web development companies are. In general, I found that jobs in the tech industry tend to have more opportunities to work remote, earn a competitive salary, and be tolerable all while giving you the opportunity to maintain a good work life balance. Another cool thing that I found out about web development is how you can pretty much teach yourself many of the skills necessary to be able to be a successful, skilled web developer. Sure, taking this class and the next class in the web development series at MSU will help progress my skills, but there are thousands of courses online that I can also use to sharpen and improve my skills. Another thing that I really find interesting about web development is the combination of creativity and logic. I really like the fact that there is such an element of creativity when developing websites. When I would code in python in the past, it would usually just be for the purpose of completing a math or logic problem. I find it very rewarding to actually have a real output that I can be proud of through web development.
